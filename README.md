# Lambdata CodingDuckMx module (v0.0.0.2)

During Lambda School's core curriculum, one lecture was about how to code a module for Python.  This module I made is a simple module that splits a data set into train and test sets. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
pandas
numpy

## Using the package from PIPY instructions:

```py

from lamddata_cdmx.mymod import my_function

my_function(dataframe) # dataframe with boolean values if null, and split values into train and test subset

```


## Deployment
